## About this Cource <br>
Get up and running with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to describe how your app should be displayed in a very easy to understand way. It also helps eliminate the complexity that comes with updating your DOM elements when the user interacts with your application. React provides a new way to think about building web applications and will change the way you think about interactivity on the web.

1. First Steps in React <br>
React is a powerful tool for building and maintaining your application’s user interface. It differs from many other toolsets in that it focuses on building components and structure in JavaScript, and not in HTML pages or templates. In this stage we’ll learn where React comes from, what problems it solves, and how to get up and running.

2. Thinking in Components <br>
Components are the core building blocks of a React application. Being able to break your application up into reusable and composable components is critical to building scalable React applications.

3. Stateful Components <br>
In this stage you will learn how to create components that have their own internal state. This allows components to update and react to changes by updating our DOM elements.

4. Designing Data Flow <br>
State is one of the most difficult things to reason about in your application because it flows and changes over time. By carefully designing where we use state and how it is passed around our application, we can build a robust application that will be easy to understand and maintain.

5. Component Lifecycle <br>
React provides several lifecycle hooks that can be very useful when building components that interact with other parts of your application. In this stage we’ll build a stopwatch component that will track time using JavaScript’s setInterval functionality.
